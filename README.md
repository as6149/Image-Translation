# Image-Translation
This is an android application created by using Android Studio, Java, XML and JSON. 
The application lets users read sign boards or text written in different languages. 
The application uses Google Mobile Vision API for optical character reading and Google Cloud Translation API for text conversion. 
Mobile Vision API reads text from an image and the application sends a JSON request to the Cloud Translation API server. 
The translated text is then returned by the API as a JSON object which is parsed by the application to give the user a meaningful output. 
The mobile device running the application requires an internet connection, Android OS 4.4 or above and quality image taking capability for the application to work accurately. 
The main objective of this application is to let users understand text written in different languages by just capturing or selecting an image from the deviceâ€™s gallery. 
This way a user will not have to type in the text in order to translate.
